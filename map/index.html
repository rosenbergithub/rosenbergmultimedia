	<h1>Lighting District's Dim Future</h1>

	<h3>by Josh Rosenberg</h3>

<div class="intro">
	<p id="text1">“Light” has long been a symbol of perseverance and strength, but for the historic lighting district in the Bowery, small business owners are starting to feel burnt out.</p>
	<p id="text1">Once a bustling tourist destination full of door-to-door lighting stores, the Bowery in the Lower East Side has shrunk from over 21 stores to around 10 in just a decade. If the trend is to continue, the lighting district could be a thing of the past by 2040.</p>
	<p id="text1">“People used to be waiting at the doors to open,” said Marcus Roman, the general manager and lighting consultant for O’Lampia, a lighting studio that’s been located at 155 Bowery for over thirty years. “We don’t get the traffic we used to get,” he continued.</p>
	<p id="text1">Unable to compete with Amazon, and other large online warehouses that offer customers marked-down prices and express delivery, the impact of the internet is doing much more than hurting small businesses, but also changing entire neighborhoods.</p>
	<p id="text1">Below, the interactive map details which of the 21 stores remain open and which have since closed in the past decade.</p>

<div class="intro">
	<p id="text1">Once a seedy street full of drugs and prostitution known as Skid Row, the Bowery transformed into a tourist shopping destination full of bright lights and dazzling fixtures. As developers continue to carve out the area however, a street devoid of crime and full of empty storefronts provide ample space for luxury, high-rise apartments.</p>
	<p id="text1">Stores such as Galaxy Lighting Inc. and Lendy’s Electric Lighting Showroom revealed a near-doubling of their monthly rent since 2010, which, coupled with competition from online warehouses like Amazon, has been crippling the neighborhood.</p>
	<p id="text1">“It’s more expensive every year,” Roman remarked, “everybody’s leaving.”</p>
