	<h1>PUBLIC SCHOOL ARTS FUNDING</h1>

	<p id="text1">by Josh Rosenberg</p>

<div class="intro">
	<p id="text1">When public schools are forced to manage budgets due to low funding, the first programs to get cut are usually the arts programs, including music, visual arts, theater, and dance, to name a few. In a study conducted by The Department of Education, over 1,400 educators in the city were asked to answer a survey that asked about the amount of funding their school received, in which a majority of the responses answered “insufficient.”</p>
	<p id="text1">"Most arts programs provide children a safe place to express themselves," said Amanda Morales, director of communications for the Center for Arts Education.</p>

	<p id="text1">To make matters worse, 83% of the educators who took part in the DOE study marked that funding over the last three years has either decreased or remained the same. Efforts are being made by advocacy groups to push for more funding in our public schools, but one can only surmise that funding will continue to decrease without support at the federal level.</p>
