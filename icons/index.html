	<h1>SAVE EAST RIVER PARK</h1>

<div class="intro">
	<p id="text1">New York Cityâ€™s flood prevention plan for East River Park in the Lower East Side of Manhattan has been seven years in the making. The initiative began back in 2012 after Hurricane Sandy hit New York causing over $70 billion in damages. The city is planning a $1.45 billion project to rebuild the entire park above an added eight feet of landfill over the course of 3.5 years. Climate activists and residents of the Lower East Side are rallying together to save East River Park!</p>
